The AI engineer was tasked with creating a clone of soogle.io, an SEO platform. The approach taken followed a predefined 5-step development workflow, prioritizing a frontend-first build with mocked data. The engineer began by thoroughly analyzing user-provided screenshots and conducting web research to understand the original application's features and design.

Significant progress was made in building the frontend UI. The engineer implemented the Homepage, Signup page, and core dashboard components (Dashboard Layout, Sidebar, Main Dashboard, Backlinks, Performance pages). This was achieved through two bulk file writes, demonstrating an efficient initial setup. Mock data was used as per instructions to ensure a functional UI prototype.

The current state reveals a runtime error related to a missing Link import after a screenshot attempt. The AI engineer is actively addressing this issue, indicating adherence to the debugging and iterative development process. The project is currently in the frontend development phase, aiming for a complete UI with mock data before proceeding to backend integration.

<product_requirements>
The primary objective is to build a full clone of soogle.io, an AI-driven SEO platform for website optimization, backlink management, keyword ranking, and site performance monitoring. The application must replicate the original website's design, including all images, icons, and elements, based on provided screenshots of the Home page, Get Started (Signup) page, and the Backlinks dashboard. The dashboard specifically requires sub-pages: Main Dashboard, Performance, SEO Audit, and SERP. The clone should offer the full visual and interactive experience of the original site, initially with mocked data, before transitioning to full functionality.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **React**: Frontend framework for building the user interface.
- **FastAPI**: Python framework for the backend API.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for data persistence.
- **Shadcn UI**: Component library for modern, styled UI elements.
- **Axios**: HTTP client for making API requests from the frontend.
- **React Router DOM**: For client-side routing and navigation.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For utility-first CSS styling.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a full-stack architecture with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database.

**Directory Structure:**



**Key Files and Their Importance:**

-   : The main entry point for the React application. Initially had basic boilerplate. Post-updates, it now orchestrates routing for the Homepage, SignupPage, and likely integrates the DashboardLayout and its sub-pages. It includes global API configuration.
-   : **Newly created.** This file is crucial for the frontend-only phase, containing all mock data necessary to render the UI components and pages as if they were populated by a backend. This adheres to the frontend-first with mock data strategy.
-   : **Newly created.** Implements the main landing page of the Soogle.io clone, including hero sections, features, and social proof, based on provided screenshots.
-   : **Newly created.** Represents the Get Started or signup interface, replicating the design from the screenshots.
-   : **Newly created.** A reusable component for the application's header, likely containing navigation and branding elements.
-   : **Newly created.** A reusable component for the application's footer.
-   : **Newly created.** This file serves as the layout wrapper for all dashboard-related pages, likely including the sidebar and main content area.
-   : **Newly created.** Implements the navigation sidebar for the dashboard, containing links to its various sub-pages.
-   : **Newly created.** Represents the primary dashboard overview page.
-   : **Newly created.** Implements the specific backlink tracking dashboard page.
-   : **Newly created.** Implements the site performance monitoring page within the dashboard.
-   : The FastAPI backend application. It includes basic CRUD operations for a  model and a root endpoint. It uses  for async MongoDB operations.
-   : Lists all Python dependencies for the FastAPI backend.
-   : Manages frontend dependencies, including React, React Router DOM, Axios, Shadcn UI components, and Tailwind CSS.
</code_architecture>
<pending_tasks>
- Complete the implementation of all remaining dashboard sub-pages: SEO Audit, SERP, Google Ads, Blog, FAQ, and Contact.
- Fix the identified runtime error related to a missing Link import in the frontend.
- Begin backend development, including database models, API endpoints, and business logic, as per the  protocol (once created).
- Replace all mock data in the frontend with actual data from the backend APIs.
- Initiate comprehensive testing of both backend and frontend.

<current_work>
The current work focuses entirely on the frontend development of the soogle.io clone, aiming for an exact replication of the original website's UI/UX using mock data. The AI engineer has successfully built the following key sections: the Homepage, the Get Started/Signup page, and the foundational structure of the Dashboard.

For the dashboard, the  and  components have been created to establish the overall structure and navigation. Additionally, three out of the required nine dashboard sub-pages have been implemented: , , and . All interactive elements on these pages are designed to work as frontend elements using mocked data from  to simulate functionality.

Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer used the  to visually verify the frontend's appearance and functionality. The tool confirmed that the Homepage and Signup pages were loading correctly and screenshots were captured. However, the  also reported runtime errors related to missing Link import. The AI engineer acknowledged this error and stated the immediate next action is to fix this specific import issue and review frontend logs for further details.
